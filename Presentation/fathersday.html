				<section data-background-color="white">Happy Father's Day. This is a walkthrough of some of my favorite activities with my dad.</section>

				<section data-background-image="https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/00/96/13/71/360_F_96137109_ojPuIAl4e3LqslKAMxJ5CgmbqOQeCcHr.jpg">A big part of my identity is my attachment to football. Since I was little my dad always took me to play football whether it was a catch in the park or playing flag football. An especially important part in my relationship with him was when he would coach my flag football team every weekend for almost 8 years of my life.</section>

				<section data-background-image="https://www.prosportsbackgrounds.com/wp-content/uploads/New-York-Jets-wallpaper-logo-desktop-2023-thumb.jpg">As well as playing football, I also love to watch it. As many know, with my constant outfits containing Jets logos, the Jets are a big part of my life and something that rain or shine I will always watch. I grew up everyweekend sitting on the couch and watching football with my dad and was a great way to bond and create a strong relationship with him.</section>

				<section data-background-image="https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/03/74/28/58/360_F_374285858_KzJ88FysqJ79AhyNPW2lqnBtsRTokuav.jpg">I also really enjoy the arts. Performing, especially being in a play, and acting in front of hundreds of people is a great escape for me. The best part about it though, is that my dad supports me 100% through it. He always understands the steep rehersals that I have to go through and never persuades me away from it to focus on football or school.</section>

				<section data-background-image="https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/02/18/27/02/360_F_218270228_KCXbaUMhU3QNbzBzKtolFivGozSAdeuo.jpg">Even though I have a lot of interests that don't pertain to school, soemthing in school that I really enjoy is chemistry. There's something about being able to do different experiments and learn through doing that is incredibly interesting to me. I hope to be able to continue my interest through college and major in chemistry there. My dad wants me to succeed and be the best version of myself I possibly can. Because of this, he is always offering to take me to tour schools and really allows my decisions to take precedent over what he thinks.</section>

				<section data-background-color="white">I love you dad. Thank you.</section>
