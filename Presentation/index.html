				<section data-background-color="white">Hi, my name is Stephen and what follows will be a walk through some of my favorite interests.</section>

				<section data-background-image="https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/00/96/13/71/360_F_96137109_ojPuIAl4e3LqslKAMxJ5CgmbqOQeCcHr.jpg">A big part of my identity is my attachment to football. Although I'm not the biggest guy in the world I still try and find enjoyment in the sport by being on Dalton's football team.</section>

				<section data-background-image="https://www.prosportsbackgrounds.com/wp-content/uploads/New-York-Jets-wallpaper-logo-desktop-2023-thumb.jpg">As well as playing football, I also love to watch it. As many know, with my constant outfits containing Jets logos, the Jets are a big part of my life and something that rain or shine I will always watch.</section>

				<section data-background-image="https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/03/74/28/58/360_F_374285858_KzJ88FysqJ79AhyNPW2lqnBtsRTokuav.jpg">Although football is something I love, going to the complete opposite side of the spectrum, I also really enjoy the arts. Performing, whether it be in a play or dancing on a stage is something that I love to do. I love being able to escape from life and just do something I enjoy in front of hundreds of people.</section>

				<section data-background-image="https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/02/18/27/02/360_F_218270228_KCXbaUMhU3QNbzBzKtolFivGozSAdeuo.jpg">Even though I have a lot of interests that don't pertain to school, soemthing in school that I really enjoy is chemistry. There's something about being able to do different experiments and learn through doing that is incredibly interesting to me. I hope to be able to continue my interest through college and major in chemistry there.</section>

				<section data-background-color="white">Thank you.</section>
