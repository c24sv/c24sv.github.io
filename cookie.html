	1. listen for the mouse's position on the document

	2. creat a function that makes a div

	3. position the left of the div we make at the mouse's X coordinate and the top at the mouse's Y coordinate

	4. style the divs by adding a class to the cookie divs and adding their style to css

		At some point we need to style the cookie divs by adding a class to the cookie divs and adding their style to css -->

	<script type="text/javascript">

		
		document.addEventListener("click", function makeCookie (event){

		console.log(event.clientX, event.clientY)
