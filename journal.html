 <h1>Journal</h1>
 <h2>Journal Entry 1:</h2>
<p>
	Allthough I missed the first few classes of our CS class I feel like I have a <em>somewhat</em> strong feel on the design and emphasis of the class and html. I understand that allthough it may seem kind of easy when you know what you are doing, sometimes it can become very tedious when there is a mistake and you are struggling to figure out what is wrong. <strong>Overall I am very excited for this class and can't wait to get a firm grip on CS and html.</strong>
</p>
<h2>Journal Entry 2:</h2>
<p>
	So far in Computer Science I have been working on making a solid frame and foundation for my website. That includes making the main page be the home page which can acess other subpages, for example, my projects, my journal and a page about myself. Although I have not really added to these subpages since I have been focusing the majority of my time on making a framework that is presentable, I plan in the near future to have these subpages contain information about my computer science experience and also store other projects that I create going forward.

<h2>Journal Entry 3:</h2>
<p>
	Although I was out about a week with a concussion and I still have stuff to learn, I have been able to make a strong website that I feel I can now proudly present. It has been hard to be able to keep up in the class with how many classes I missed but I still feel like I have a solid grasp on the material. I hope to catch up further and be on par with everyone else when we start doing javascript. Although javascript does seem hard, at the same time it seems like there is a lot of interesting and fun stuff that can be done with it. All in all I am excited to be able to code more exciting material.

<h2>Journal Entry 4:</h2>
<p>
	I think my code works by writing a command in the code, in this case 'hover,' and then in my code I give it instructions to perform when the command of 'hovering' is done. In this annimation, when I hover over the first image it makes a whole rotation for 2 seconds and transforms into a new image, in this case a gif. I decided to make this annimation because I wanted to see how the transition would happen and if it would slowly fade into the new image or just switch without a smooth transition. I thought the switch of images would look cool when there was a rotation. Kind of if the rotation was changing the images.

<h2>Journal Entry 5:</h2>
<h3>What is an event listener? What is an event? How do you get it to show up in console? How do you get "into" console.log and the different "attributes" of an event?</h3>
<p>
	An event listener is the way to say what you want to do in your function in order for your action to run. For example this can be like a click of your mouse. An event is the attributes of where you make your action (like a click). You get it to show up in the console by saying "console.log(event)." In order to get into one aspect of the event you want is by saying, "console.log and then writing which specific aspect you want to occur." This is done by saying "event.(which aspect you want)". This basically means go from the whole event page down into the specific part you want.

<h2>Journal Entry 6 (Christmas Card):</h2>
<p>For my third project, I was tasked with creating a card that played music using event listeners. To do this we had to come up with a way to make it so when we clicked once it, the music played, but when we clicked again, the music stopped. We did this by making a function that said when our click had a remainder of 1 when dividing by 2, the song played and when our click had no remainder when dividing by 2, our song stopped. This is basically just saying that on an odd click the song plays and on an even click the song pauses. Originally I was going to add a image that appeared and disappeared  the same as the song, but when I did it I realized I thought it would be better if it was always there. The one frusturating thing about making it was actually positioning the image. Everytime I tried to make it stay at the center bottom of the page it would always stay at the top. I fixed this by watching one of Molly's videos and found out the correct commands for how to position it. </p>

<h2>Journal Entry 7 (Squares):</h2>
<p>
	Basically how this project works is that your creating a function "makeSquare" with the input x. The variable in this function is a square and in that variable contains the styling for the square. We then have a second function that gives the squares a value of i. In this function we can say how many squares we want by setting a starting and ending value for i and then saying how much you want i to count by. I set i to start at 0 and to go up to 20 by incriments of 2. This creates 11 squares with the style provided. In order to change the style of an individual square, I copied and pasted that original function, except changed the background color from red to green. In order to set which square I wanted this to affect, instead of setting the input to i, I set the input to i=0 so the first square gets affected by the style change.
</p>

<h2>Journal Entry 8 (Array):</h2>
<p>
	For this project I made a Christmas array. Basically what I did is I created a green background and an array of red names (these are the names of my family, including my cats). Basically this array works because: first we are establishing the names to equal "myNames". We are then establishing, every time we click, a random number (0-1), which is then multiplied by 6, and rounded down, this is equal to "names". We then establish that "names" and "myNames" are equivalent. Then what happens is a random number is selected, and that number corresponds with a name, and then that name is displayed on the website.
