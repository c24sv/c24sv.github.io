 <h1>Journal</h1>
 <h2>Journal Entry 1:</h2>
<p>
	Allthough I missed the first few classes of our CS class I feel like I have a <em>somewhat</em> strong feel on the design and emphasis of the class and html. I understand that allthough it may seem kind of easy when you know what you are doing, sometimes it can become very tedious when there is a mistake and you are struggling to figure out what is wrong. <strong>Overall I am very excited for this class and can't wait to get a firm grip on CS and html.</strong>

<h2>Journal Entry 2:</h2>
<p>
	So far in Computer Science I have been working on making a solid frame and foundation for my website. That includes making the main page be the home page which can acess other subpages, for example, my projects, my journal and a page about myself. Although I have not really added to these subpages since I have been focusing the majority of my time on making a framework that is presentable, I plan in the near future to have these subpages contain information about my computer science experience and also store other projects that I create going forward.

<h2>Journal Entry 3:</h2>
<p>
	Although I was out about a week with a concussion and I still have stuff to learn, I have been able to make a strong website that I feel I can now proudly present. It has been hard to be able to keep up in the class with how many classes I missed but I still feel like I have a solid grasp on the material. I hope to catch up further and be on par with everyone else when we start doing javascript. Although javascript does seem hard, at the same time it seems like there is a lot of interesting and fun stuff that can be done with it. All in all I am excited to be able to code more exciting material.
