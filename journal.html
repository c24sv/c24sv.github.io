 <h2>Journal Entry 1:</h2>
<p>
	Allthough I missed the first few classes of our CS class I feel like I have a <em>somewhat</em> strong feel on the design and emphasis of the class and html. I understand that allthough it may seem kind of easy when you know what you are doing, sometimes it can become very tedious when there is a mistake and you are struggling to figure out what is wrong. <strong>Overall I am very excited for this class and can't wait to get a firm grip on CS and html.</strong>
